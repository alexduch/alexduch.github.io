Welcome !

This is my online resume. You can view it [here](https://alexduch.github.io/).

I started it as a pretext to play around with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), and it was initially a single HTML file. 
I quickly realized, however, that it would be painfull to update with my latest work experience if the data and the layout were so 
interwoven. So I put the data in a JSON file and wrote a small JQuery script to load it.
Seeing the HTML templates in my Javascript code, I thought this would be a good use case for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and 
a good occasion to learn about this framework. And that's more or less how this project reach its current state.

Any feedback would be welcome !

That's it ! I didn't think I would wrote a README this long for a so small repository.
